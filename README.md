# Churn Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and various interpretability methods (SHAP, LIME) to understand model predictions. The project is built using Python and several popular libraries.

## Features

- Load and preprocess dataset
- Train machine learning models (e.g., KNeighborsClassifier)
- Generate Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
- Perform global and local SHAP analysis
- Explain individual predictions using LIME
- Calculate feature importance using LOCO (Leave One Covariate Out)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib shap lime fastapi uvicorn pydantic
```

## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Update the `file_path` variable in the main execution section of the code to point to your dataset.
2. **Train Model**: Ensure you have trained your model (e.g., KNeighborsClassifier) and saved it as a `.joblib` file.
3. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the main script to perform data loading, model training, and analysis.

```bash
python app.py
```

## Data

The dataset should be in CSV format and should contain a target column for churn. Update the `target_column` variable in the code to match your dataset's target column name.

## Modeling

The main model used in this project is `KNeighborsClassifier` and deployed using joblib, but you can easily replace it with other classifiers by modifying the training section of the code.

## Interpretability

This project utilizes SHAP and LIME for model interpretability:

- **SHAP**: Provides global and local explanations for model predictions.
- **LIME**: Offers local explanations for individual predictions.

### Example of SHAP Analysis

```python
global_shap_analysis(model, X_train.values, X_test.values)
```

### Example of LIME Explanation

```python
lime_explain(model, X_train.values, X_test.values, instance_idx=0)
```

## Deployment

The churn analysis application has been deployed using FastAPI. You can access the deployed application at:

To run the application locally, use:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

This command will start a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
